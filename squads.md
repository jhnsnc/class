# Squads

At the start of each unit in the course, we'll randomly match you and a couple of other students into a squad. Think of your squad as your primary support group for the current unit.

Take advantage of your squad to:

* Ask questions about homework
* Ask for feedback on homework or projects
* Participate in pair programming/group activities during the unit

Your squad is **not** the same as the group you'll have for the unit group project.
