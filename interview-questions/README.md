# Interview Questions

Here is a collection of common interview questions. Many questions are difficult to answer and you certainly don't need to have a perfect answer for every question in order to get an entry-level position. Practicing answers for these common questions will help you develop a foundation to represent yourself well in interviews.

Interviewers will ask you many different questions and you will not have an answer for everything. You need to accept that now and additionally practice how to gracefully answer "I don't know."
