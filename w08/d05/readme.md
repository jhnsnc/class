### Overview

This unit's project will be a deep-dive into the power of front end frameworks, specifically React. You will be building an app that will focus on the client side with a much smaller emphasis on the back end (database is optional).

You will be working in groups to design and build a React or React Native app that makes AJAX calls to at least 1 (preferably more) API and renders in a single page application. We are keeping the guidelines loose so you can get creative with your project ideas. Keep in mind what makes React so cool when brainstorming ideas - self-contained components, modularity, performance, maintainability, etc. Please make sure the instructor team approves anything before you begin coding.

### UXDI Collaboration

Your team has come up with a basic idea for a start-up and you've been given one week to develop a prototype. At the end of the week, you will present your prototype to a group of investors who will decide whether or not to fund your startup.

The investors have graciously agreed to pay a UX consulting firm to help you refine your idea into an actionable plan. They will only be able to help your team for a few hours, so make sure you take full advantage of it.

They will help you better understand the problem you are solving, the people who will use your product/service, and possible ways to build your solution. They are not necessarily technical experts, but they are skilled at helping study and analyze problems.

**Basically, the group of UX designers will be helping you understand, plan your project, and develop wireframes.**

- Morning stand-ups will begin at 9:15am each morning during project week
- Friday 11/3 @ 9am - 12:30pm: Meet with UXDI for feedback, planning & wireframing
- Friday 11/3 @ 12:30pm - 1:30pm: Immersive Improv!!
- Friday 11/10 @ 12pm - 1pm: Early Lunch Break
- Friday 11/10 @ 1pm: Final Presentations

### Necessary Deliverables

- You must come up with a team name
- A working web app, built by the whole team, hosted somewhere on the internet
- A link to your hosted working app in the URL section of your Github repo
- A team git repository hosted on Github with frequent commits from every team member dating back to the very beginning of the project
- A `readme.md` file with technologies used, the approach taken, unsolved problems, user stories, wireframes, hosted working app, etc.

### Potential APIs to get the creative juices flowin'

- google APIs: maps, places, books, directions, youtube
- yahoo APIs: answers, meme, flickr
- yelp API
- zillow
- soundcloud
- dropbox
- twitter
- twilio
- [famous quotes](https://theysaidso.com/api/)
- [game of thrones](https://market.mashape.com/orthosie/dothraki-translator)
- NPR
- spotify
- wunderground weather
- [nutritionix](http://www.nutritionix.com/business/api)
- [pokemon](http://pokeapi.co/)
- goodreads

> Note: Many APIs will require a private API key. Typically we want those API keys stored on the back-end but given the time constraints of this project, the API key may be used on the front-end **as long** as it mentioned in the README.md how this is not best practice but used for demo-ing only.

### Tips

* Work together initially to come up with wireframes, user stories, ERD's etc, but adopt a "divide and conquer" type approach afterwards
* Try pair programming through the tougher parts of your application
* Deploy early, don't wait until the day before to attempt doing this
* COMMUNICATE!
